### **Class Activation Maps (CAM)**  

**CAM visualizations** provide insights into the model's decision-making:  
- Heatmaps reveal the image regions most influential in classification.  
- Misclassified examples show scattered attention, indicating potential areas for further optimization.  

#### **Examples of CAM**:  
- Correct classifications emphasize relevant textures and objects in the images.  
- Misclassified examples display poor focus, leading to incorrect predictions.
